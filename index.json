The scheme is based on a mapping of a subset of the thermochemical scalars’ vector between incremental and adaptive time steps. The subset corresponds to variables that are adequate to represent the evolution of the chemical system. The DeepONet-based scheme also relies on a mapping of the solution of this subset onto a corresponding solution at an adaptive time increment to overcome the restrictive requirements of integrating such solutions with stiff chemistry. Training for the DeepONet is also implemented differently from previous approaches to the solution of PDEs with DeepONets. Instead of constructing solutions from their initial to their final states using DeepONets, the training relies on prescribed short-horizon time windows for training where intermediate solutions also serve as initial states for training. An additional framework of latent-space kinetics identification with modified DeepONet is proposed, which enhances the computational efficiency and widens the applicability of the proposed scheme. The scheme is demonstrated on the “simple” chemical kinetics of hydrogen oxidation and the more complex chemical kinetics of n-dodecane high- and low-temperatures. The proposed framework accurately learns the chemical kinetics and efficiently reproduces species and temperature temporal profiles. Moreover, a very large speed-up with a good extrapolation capability is also observed with the proposed scheme.","tags":["Surrogate Modeling","Machine Learning","Chemical Kinetics"],"title":"Combustion chemistry acceleration with DeepONets","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706878800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706878800,"objectID":"9b9babc1781ab31599626285b616de02","permalink":"https://anujv12.github.io/talk/efficient-and-physically-consistent-surrogate-modeling-of-chemical-kinetics-using-deep-operator-networks/","publishdate":"2024-02-02T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/efficient-and-physically-consistent-surrogate-modeling-of-chemical-kinetics-using-deep-operator-networks/","section":"event","summary":"Presented at The Crunch Group, Divion of Applied Mathematics, Brown University","tags":[],"title":"Efficient and Physically Consistent Surrogate Modeling of Chemical Kinetics Using Deep Operator Networks","type":"event"},{"authors":["Arsalan Taassob","Anuj Kumar","Kevin M.

The technique is based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that combines models for velocity and scalar measurements and a deep operator network (DeepONet) to accommodate spatial measurements and experimental parameters as separate input streams. An additional key innovation is the estimate of the unconditional means of the species’ chemical source terms as additional “observations” to constrain the prediction of these rates. This estimate is based on a convolution of the means of species reaction rates conditioned on principal components of the multiscalar data and the joint probability density functions of these principal components. The PINN-DeepONet method is implemented on the so-called Sydney flames, where training is carried out on 3 flames and validated on 4 flames. The results show that, despite the limited samples of experimental parameters, including the inlet flow and the fuel jet recess length within the air flow, the PINN-DeepONet approach can construct velocity and scalar fields along with important closure terms for turbulent transport and reaction rates.","tags":["DeepONet","PINN","Turbulent combustion"],"title":"A PINN-DeepONet framework for extracting turbulent combustion closure from multiscalar measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702648800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702648800,"objectID":"24bcabc6df7b11690cea5096e2c0d0de","permalink":"https://anujv12.github.io/talk/physics-informed-machine-learning-for-reduced-space-chemical-kinetics/","publishdate":"2023-12-15T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/physics-informed-machine-learning-for-reduced-space-chemical-kinetics/","section":"event","summary":"Presented at Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2023","tags":[],"title":"Physics - Informed Machine Learning for Reduced Space Chemical Kinetics","type":"event"},{"authors":["Tadbhagya Kumar","Anuj Kumar","Pinaki Pal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702598400,"objectID":"c3cf561464354ea10eb180e9f2b91905","permalink":"https://anujv12.github.io/publication/ml4ps_neurips_tadbhagya/","publishdate":"2023-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ml4ps_neurips_tadbhagya/","section":"publication","summary":"The high computational cost associated with solving for detailed chemistry poses a significant challenge for predictive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of turbulent reacting flows. These models often require solving a system of coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While deep learning techniques have been experimented with to develop faster surrogate models, they often fail to integrate reliably with CFD solvers. This instability arises because deep learning methods optimize for training error without ensuring compatibility with ODE solvers, leading to accumulation of errors over time. Recently, NeuralODE-based techniques have offered a promising solution by effectively modeling chemical kinetics. In this study, we extend the NeuralODE framework for stiff chemical kinetics by incorporating mass conservation constraints directly into the loss function during training. This ensures that the total mass and the elemental mass are conserved, a critical requirement for reliable downstream integration with CFD solvers. Our results demonstrate that this enhancement not only improves the physical consistency with respect to mass conservation criteria but also ensures better robustness and makes the training process more computationally efficient.","tags":["Physics Informed Machine Learning","Neural ODE","Machine Learning","Chemical Kinetics"],"title":"A Physics-Constrained NeuralODE Approach for Robust Learning of Stiff Chemical Kinetics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anuj Kumar","Tarek Echekki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702598400,"objectID":"3b12815284fefbd39b1f3d0ce8eedb03","permalink":"https://anujv12.github.io/publication/ml4ps_neurips/","publishdate":"2023-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ml4ps_neurips/","section":"publication","summary":"Modeling detailed chemical kinetics stands as a primary challenge in combustion simulations.

Previous studies were mainly limited to replicating relatively-simple chemistry in canonical configurations. The objective of the present study, therefore, is to further explore the accuracy of PC-transport ROM on more complex combustion phenomenon where, for example, large hydrocarbon fuel chemistry spanning a broad range of thermochemical space governs sequential multi-stage compression ignition processes. The cumulative error of PC-transport for this problem, and for others that depend upon sequential highly nonlinear physics, has to be minimal as the combustion phasing and heat release rate in internal combustion engines depends upon accurate predictions of minor ignition species whose concentrations start from ashes and grow orders of magnitude over the course of low- and high-temperature autoignition. Specifically, the PC-transport ROM is applied to predict the compression ignition characteristics of lean-heptane/air and primary reference fuel (PRF)/air mixtures in a two-dimensional (2-D) constant volume computational domain initialized with a two-dimensional isotropic turbulence spectrum and temperature inhomogeneities. PCA is used to define the low-dimensional manifold that represents the original thermochemical state vector, and artificial neural network (ANN) models are adopted to tabulate chemical kinetics, transport, and thermodynamic properties. A series of 2-D pseudo-turbulent simulations are performed at engine pressures by varying the initial mean and r.m.s. of temperature, turbulence intensity, and the composition of fuel/air mixture. The results show that the PC-transport ROM accurately reproduces the instantaneous and statistical ignition characteristics of the fuel/air mixture, aided by pre-processing techniques including species subsetting, data clustering, and data transformation. It is found that PCs are not properly scaled with a power transformer if reactants are included in the species subset, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of the PC-transport ROM. A separation of the reactants from the species subset ensures that the temporal evolution of the PCs starts from zero and spans orders of magnitude with time, and as such, this approach is found to effectively redistribute both PCs and their source terms with a power transformer. The computational speed-up factor of the PC-transport ROM ranges between 5.1 and 15.0 for the cases with-heptane/air mixture and PRF/air mixture, respectively. Moreover, a potential further speed-up is anticipated through a combination of reduction in grid resolution requirements and in the stiffness of the chemical system. As an example, many of the pre-processing methods for inhomogeneous compression ignition may also apply to other complex intermittent combustion phenomena.","tags":["PC Tranport","Reduced Order Modeling","Machine Learning","Turbulent Combustion"],"title":"On the application of principal component transport for compression ignition of lean fuel/air mixtures under engine relevant conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anuj Kumar","Martin Rieth","Opeoluwa Owoyele","Jacqueline H.

Further acceleration is achieved by a treatment for bottlenecks associated with the acoustic time steps for low Mach number flows. The approach is implemented in 2D and 3D on a laboratory scale lean premixed methane-air flame stabilized on a slot burner. DNS based on the transport of thermochemical scalars (species and energy) is also carried out, first to develop a 2D DNS database for PC-transport equations’ closure terms and, second, to validate the approach against species DNS in 2D and 3D, a principal goal of the present effort. The results show that surrogate PC DNS can reproduce instantaneous profiles as well as statistics associated with turbulence, flame topology properties and measures of flame-turbulence interactions.
